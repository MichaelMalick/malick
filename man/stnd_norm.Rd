\title{Standardizes a vector to a N(0, 1) distribution}
\usage{
stnd_norm(x, na.rm = TRUE, tol = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector}

\item{na.rm}{logical, if TRUE NA's are removed for computing the mean and
standard deviation.}

\item{tol}{tolerance of similarity between elements in the vector, if
    each element is within the tolerance of each other a vector
    of zeros is returned}
}
\value{
Returns a vector the same length as x
}
\description{
This function standardizes a vector by taking each element of the
    vector and subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
    deviation of the vector.
}
\details{
You can set a tolerance level, which is required if the values in
    the vector to be standardized are equal. If all values in the
    vector are within the 'tol' level of each other the standardized
    values will be set to 0.

\examples{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 4, 5)
stnd_norm(x)

y <- rep(3.1, 10)
stnd_norm(y)
