# malick
*An R package containing random but personally useful functions.*



# Overview
This R package is a collection of functions that I use on regular
basis in the analysis of fisheries and oceanographic data. This
package is not on CRAN, but can be installed from R using:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github(repo = "michaelmalick/r-malick")
    library(malick)
